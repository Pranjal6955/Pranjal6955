# Hi! I'm Pranjal Negi

I'm a student at Polaris School of Technology who loves technology and building cool stuff.

I work with websites, AI, blockchain, and other tech projects. I know JavaScript, MERN Stack, Python, and Docker. I love open source projects and learning new things.

I want to build things that help people. Always happy to work together on fun projects!
